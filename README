SASS Sprite generator

Quick and dirty php-script for generating a sprite and corresponding SASS markup (http://sass-lang.com/) from a folder of png images. Using an image from the generated sprite as a background for element requires you to just do an include with the image name. After setup up adding more images to the sprite and using them in your project is trivial.

Requirements:
- PHP 5.3
- GD lib
- optionally pngcrush (http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/)

How to use:
1. Put your images to a desired folder
2. Setup script
3. Run script
4. Include generated .scss -file to your project: '@include xyz.scss;'
5. Using it in a .scss document: 'eg. span#button { @include some_image_name; }'
